webextension for chrome and firefox > 47

This extension run **phantomJS script** into you browser. Its goal is to capture and replay scenario and export in Javascript **PhantomJS** (or **CasperJS**) code (and JSON).

My inspiration comes from Resurectio, SeBuilder, GhostInspector, Selenium ...

Have a try !!!
