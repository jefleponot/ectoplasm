webextension for chrome and firefox > 47 for PhantomJS developpers.

This extension runs **PhantomJS script** into you browser. Its goal is to capture and to replay scenario before exporting them into Javascript **PhantomJS** (or **CasperJS**) code (and JSON).

My inspiration comes from Resurectio, SeBuilder, GhostInspector, Selenium ...

Have a try !!!
